Data Structures Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of several fundamental data structures as part of an assignment in a Data Structures course. The following data structures are implemented:

Dynamic Hash Table

A dynamic hash table that automatically resizes as needed to maintain efficient performance for insertions, deletions, and lookups.

Rank Tree

A Rank Tree, which is an AVL tree augmented with additional information to enable efficient ranking operations.

Union-Find

A data structure that supports efficient union and find operations, typically used for disjoint-set data, such as in network connectivity or Kruskal's algorithm.

Linked List

A simple linked list implementation with basic operations such as insertion and deletion.
